- This toy packages transforms inputs into "bizarro outputs". 

- It was created as an exercise for the [___Building Tidy Tools___](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/build-tidy-tools) workshop at RStudio Conference 2020. 

- It contains a single generic function `bizarro()`, powered by the R's S3 object-oriented system.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acastroaraujo/bizarro")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, error=TRUE}
library(bizarro)

bizarro("andrés castro araújo")

## works on lists
example <- list(numeric = 1:10, 
                factor = factor(stringr::fruit[1:5]),
                logical = c(TRUE, FALSE, NA, FALSE, TRUE)
                )

bizarro(example)

## works on data frames (and nested data frames)
bizarro(iris)

## doesn't work on dates
bizarro(as.Date("1990-04-03"))
```
